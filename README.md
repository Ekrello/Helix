# Toasty

Toasty aims to be one of the biggest music enabled bots on discord, and we are well on our way to achieving this

#DISCLAIMER
Toasty was origionally based on this -> https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot
All credit to the basic music system goes to them. I just forked and modified their code

##So... if you didnt make Toasty, why are you its "dev"

I originally made Toasty to play. But people liked what i did to it, so i kept going. Now its a massive bot with hundreds of servers. I call myself its dev because im the only dude who actually modifies this code. And im going my own direction against MusicBot. When ive replaced over 60& of the original code, it'll stop being a fork (im almost there)
